Background:

This project analyzes bank loan data to extract key business insights and recommendations. The dataset includes details about loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and loan statuses. The objective is to identify approval trends, risk factors, and financial patterns that impact loan decisions.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

Loan Approval and Funding Trends
Risk Assessment and Default Patterns
Borrower Demographics and Loan Purpose
Interest Rates and Debt-to-Income Analysis
The SQL queries used for data cleaning and analysis can be found in the attached script. An interactive Power BI dashboard is used to visualize and explore loan trends, borrower risk segmentation, and financial performance.

Executive Summary
Overview of Findings
Key insights derived from the analysis:

Loan approvals and funding amounts show a month-over-month (MoM) growth of 6.9% and 13%, respectively.
Bad loans (defaults) account for 13.8% of total loans, highlighting the need for better risk assessment.
Debt consolidation is the most common loan purpose, followed by home improvement and small business funding.
Insights Deep Dive
Loan Approval & Funding Trends
Main insight 1: The total number of loan applications is 38.6K, with $435.8M funded and $473.1M received.
Main insight 2: Good loans (low-risk borrowers) account for 86.2% of total funded loans.
Main insight 3: Loans are most frequently approved for debt consolidation, contributing significantly to total funded amounts.
Risk Assessment & Default Patterns
Main insight 1: 5.3K loans (~13.8%) fall under bad loans, leading to a loss of $37.3M in received amounts.
Main insight 2: The average interest rate for bad loans is higher (13.88%) compared to good loans (12.05%), indicating higher risk premiums.
Main insight 3: The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is a strong predictor of default, with bad loans having an average DTI of 14%, higher than the good loan segment.
Borrower Demographics & Loan Purpose
Main insight 1: Borrowers with higher employment length (5+ years) are more likely to get loan approvals.
Main insight 2: Renters (18.4K applicants) apply for more loans compared to homeowners, impacting risk assessments.
Main insight 3: The majority of loan applications are for debt consolidation, credit card payments, and home improvement.

Recommendations:
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made for stakeholders:
Enhance risk assessment models by incorporating DTI ratio thresholds to reduce bad loans.
Target marketing strategies towards low-risk borrowers (stable employment, homeowners, lower DTI) to improve approval rates.
Optimize interest rate policies to balance risk and profitability.
Improve customer segmentation to offer customized loan products based on employment status and loan purpose.
Implement predictive analytics to anticipate default risks and adjust approval strategies accordingly.
